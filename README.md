# Calendar App

A calendar app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed for easy scheduling and event management.

## Features

1. **Day Selection**
   - Users can click on individual days to select a date, enabling interaction with each specific day.

2. **Add Reminders**
   - Each selected day allows users to add customized reminders.
   - Reminders can be displayed directly on the calendar or in a list associated with each day, helping users keep track of daily tasks and events.

3. **Customizable Reminders**
   - Each reminder can be configured with:
     - **Name**: A title for the reminder (e.g., "Meeting," "Birthday").
     - **Time**: A specific time for the reminder, allowing users to organize events in a structured way.

4. **Time Field Compatibility**
   - On Firefox, the time input popup may not appear as it does in other browsers (e.g., Chrome). Users on Firefox will need to enter the time manually by typing it in `HH:MM` format (24-hour format).

5. **User-Friendly Interface**
   - The app features a clean and simple interface, allowing users to easily navigate between days and add reminders with minimal effort.
